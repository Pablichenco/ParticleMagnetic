# ParticleMagnetic
A non relativistic charged particle in presence of a magnetic field, LDE solved using Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4), the interactive plots was maded in plotly in with you can move around the 3d plot of the particle trayectory. 
File "Particle%20in%20a%20magnetic%20field.html" shows the different trajectories when the external field is modified and "Particle%20in%20a%20magnetic%20field%202.html" shows the trajectories when the initial velocity is changed. (ParticleMagnetic/Magnetic forse/Graficos/)

Check also the plotly web page for more info to use their tools.

Note:
for more info about the algorithm (RK4) see Richard L. Burden, J. Douglas Faires: Numerical Analisys
